# Installation

To get started with creating a new project using the ***'create-next-boost'*** command, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to create a new Next.js project using the template:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-boost [project-name]
   ```
   - Replace ***[project-name]*** with the name you want to give to your project. If you omit the project name, the command will use a default name or you can add ./ to make it in same directory.

Follow the prompts and instructions provided by the ***'create-next-boost'*** tool to set up your project.

Once the project is created and configured, navigate to the project directory using the terminal:

```bash
cd [project-name] 
```

You can now start developing your Next.js application!

Remember to replace [project-name] in the instructions with the actual name you want to give to your project. This will create a clear and informative 'Installation' page in your Vue
